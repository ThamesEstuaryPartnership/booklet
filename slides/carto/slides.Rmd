### Spatial thinking & intelligence

*"An important set of competencies for examining the world around us. These skills enable the geographer to visualise and analyse spatial relationships between objects, such as location, distance, direction, shape and pattern."* (The Association of American Geographers, 2008)

--

The capacity to imagine or visualise:

<center><p class="caption"></p></center>

--

- Positions of objects

--

- Their shapes

--

- Their spatial relations to one another and the movement they make to form new spatial relations

### Map making

--

Things to consider:

--

- Purpose of the map: 

 - Why am I making this map? 
 - What is the story that I want to tell?
 
--

- Audience: 
  - Who is it for? Novices? Experts? 
  - Why are they interested?
  
--

- Map type: 
  - What do I want to show with the map? 
  - What kind of data am I using?

--

- Map design: 
  - Is my map easy to read and interpret? 
  - Am I using visual variables and hierarchy in a right way? 
  - Is my map the right scale?

### Map design

--

When it comes to designing a map there is no one formula for a good design, however, key things needs to be considered. 

These include: 

--

- Projection

--

- Symbology - Colours

--

- Scale

--

- Legend

--

- Labeling

--

- Titles and additional text

--

- North arrow and inset map

--

- Layout

]

--

.pull-right[

Notice that the shape and size of the continents is different. 

This distortion occurs because the curved surface becomes flat subsequently affecting **shape**, **area**, **distance** and **direction**. 

The different types of projections will preserve and/or distort different attributes.

### Map design

- Projection

--

The type of projection can be based on the projection *surface* (i.e. where the flat surface is placed on the surface of the globe) and the *properties* that the projection preserves.

Projection by surface:

--

1, Planar/Azumithal: A plane is placed over the globe.

### Map design

- Projection

The type of projection can be based on the projection *surface* (i.e. where the flat surface is placed on the surface of the globe) and the *properties* that the projection preserves.

Projection by metric property:

--

- Equal-area: preserves areal relationships.

--

- Conformal: preserves local angles.

--

- Azimuthal: correct directions from the centre of the map are maintained.

--

- Equidistant: displays the true distance from one or two points on the map to any other point on the map or along specific lines.

--

- Compromise: do not entirely preserve any property but instead provide a balance of distortion between the various properties.

This projection was authored by Athelstan F. Spilhaus, a South African-American geophysicist and oceanographer, in 1942. It centers around Antarctica presenting the ocean as one body of water.

The Spilhaus projection is becoming more and more popular and it is being used to highlight that the planet is covered by one ocean (see Drop the S for more detail).

### Map design

- Projection

--

It is important to keep in mind that when a map is made distortion will always occur.

--

It is either area or shape that can be preserved, not both. 

--

Thus, the projection type used should be considered based on the data type and how the final map will be presented.

### Map design

- Symbology

--

Location and properties are represented by symbols with different size, shape, colour, and pattern. Map symbol design relies heavily on the proper use of the visual variables shown below.

Why is the water blue?

Water molecules are better at absorbing light that arrives in longer wavelengths such as reds, oranges, yellows and greens. 

This leaves blue, which has a shorter wavelength to penetrate deeper, which in turns makes water look blue.

Why is the sky blue?

As the light reaches the atmosphere it is scattered by the tiny molecules of gas in the air (referred to as Rayleigh scattering). 

Shorter wavelengths are scattered the most, so more of the blue light is scattered towards our eyes, hence the sky appears blue to us.

Two alternative representations of the RGB colour space were developed for computers to allow map makers (and designers) to mix colours more intuitively and work directly with visual variables such as hue, saturation, value/light.

HSY/HSL values are given on a cylindrical coordinate systems:

- Hue: Angle around the central vertical axis.

- Saturation/chroma: Distance from the central axis.

- Value/Lightness: Distance along the central axis.

Hue is the shade or tint of a colour and it is used to identify qualitative differences. For example blue hues are used to illustrate ocean depth.

Saturation/chroma refers to the intensity of colour. As the saturation increases, the colours appear to be more pure, while as the saturation decreases, the colours appear to be more pale. Saturation can be used to make otherwise unseen features come to the viewer’s attention.

Value (light) gives how light or dark the colour us. It is used to represent numerical difference on a quantitative scale (e.g. ranking). For example, a choropleth map that shows population density across states or countries.

The binary counting system uses only two symbols, 0 and 1, to represent numerical information. The hexadecimal numbering system on the other hand contains 16 sequential numbers as base units, including 0. This is a convenient way to express binary numbers in modern computers as one hexadecimal digit can represent the arrangement of four binary digits, while two hexadecimal digits can represent eight binary digits.

60-30-10 rule: When selecting colours it is best to choose them in a 60% (dominant hue) + 30% (secondary colour) + 10% (accent colour) proportion. This will give balance and will also be more comfortable for the map viewers’ brains.

The examples below are based on colours arranged on the colour wheel according to their chromatic relationships.

- Monochromatic colour scheme is made up from one colour with lighter and darker variations of that colour.

- Analogous colour scheme is made up of colours directly adjacent to the base colour.

- Complementary colour scheme is made up of colours opposite from each other.

- Split complementary colour scheme use two adjacent colours from the base complementary.

- Triadic colour scheme is made up from three, equidistant colours.

- Tetradic colour scheme is made up from two sets of complementary colours spaced out in a shape of a triangle.

- Square colour scheme is similar to the tetradic scheme but it is composed of four colours.

- Scale

--

When choosing a symbology, map scale (how distance is shown) should also be considered. 

--

Scale is a map’s representative fraction, expressed as a ratio of the map distance to the ground distance. 

--

For example, a scale of 1:10 means that one map unit represents 10 of the same units on the ground. 

So if two points located 10 km apart are shown 1 cm apart on a map, then the scale of the map is 1 cm to 10 km.

Scale is presented either as a word statement, ratio, fraction or scale bar.

--

--

Large scale maps have scales of 1:24,000 or larger. They show an area with more detail.

--

Small scale maps have scales of 1:500,000 or smaller. They show an area with less detail.

This is a perfect example of doing too much. Conceptually, the map makes sense, but its execution is extremely flawed. The three colors for reading, writing, and earning money combine into a muddy unintelligible colour-ramp. This means it will take an extremely long amount of time to interpret the results and the map reader has a hard time understanding the message and actionable items. Always remember, with maps, less is more!

When making a map, keep in mind whether someone with no context or knowledge would be able to understand and interpret it correctly without asking others for help. If they can’t, your map needs to be simplified.

The easy fix for the map above would be to create a red, blue, and yellow map. Creating three separate maps would have made for a meaningful series of images rather than the unintelligible, bizarre color wheel we see above.
